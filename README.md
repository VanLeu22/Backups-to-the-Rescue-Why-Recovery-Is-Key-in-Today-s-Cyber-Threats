# Backups to the Rescue: Why Recovery Is Key in Today’s Cyber Threats

I recently listened to an episode of the podcast *N2K | CyberWire*, where host Dave Bittner welcomed John A. Smith, founder of Fenix24, to discuss the importance of backups compared to prevention in cybersecurity. Smith’s insights about how backups could be more critical than stopping attacks in the first place really grabbed my attention and led me to dig deeper into this phenomenon. After exploring the topic, I decided to write this article to share what I’ve learned. In today’s digital age, cyberattacks are hitting businesses harder than ever, and 2025 looks like it’s going to be even tougher. Hackers are getting bolder, targeting not just your main systems but also your backups—the safety nets you rely on to bounce back. Let’s break it down in plain terms.

## The Growing Threat: Hackers Are Coming for Everything

Hackers aren’t just sneaking into your systems to steal data anymore. They’re now willing to lock up or wipe out everything—your production systems, your backups, and even your disaster recovery setups. Smith warns that this trend will get worse in 2025, especially for sensitive industries like healthcare and nonprofits, where downtime can literally cost lives or disrupt critical services. “What we see is threat actors having an increasing willingness to target backups and production systems for mass encryption and deletion,” he says. It’s like they’re not just breaking into your house—they’re stealing your spare key, too.

This escalation means businesses can’t just rely on firewalls and antivirus software to keep threats out. Prevention is important, but it’s not enough when hackers are this determined and creative. Industry frameworks like NIST 800-53 (with its CP-9 Backup and Recovery control), ISO 27001 (with its A.12.3 Backup control), and CIS Controls (including Control 10 for Data Recovery Capabilities) back this up, calling for strong backup and recovery strategies to handle today’s threats.

## Why Recovery Is Your Safety Net

Here’s the harsh reality: most companies think their backups and recovery plans will save them if something goes wrong, but Smith’s data shows otherwise. About 80 to 92% of the time, those plans fail when a real attack hits. Why? Many backups aren’t set up to survive modern hacker tactics, and even if they do, they often can’t get your systems back online fast enough. Secondary systems—like disaster recovery (DR) setups—get destroyed alongside everything else.

Recovery isn’t just about having a backup; it’s about making sure it works when you need it most. Smith calls this “timely recovery”—getting your critical data, like customer records or financial systems, back up and running quickly. But here’s the kicker: most businesses aren’t testing their recovery plans regularly, so they don’t even know if their backups will hold up. “Literally no one is doing this,” Smith notes, pointing out that companies focus more on protecting against natural disasters like floods or fires, which are less likely than cyberattacks.

## The Problem with Prevention-Only Thinking

A lot of businesses pour money into preventing breaches—think fancy security tools, employee training, and monitoring systems. That’s great, but Smith argues we’re overdoing it. “All organizations are overinvesting in resistance and largely ignoring recovery,” he says. The problem? You can’t stop every attack. Hackers will find a way in eventually, and when they do, you need a solid plan to recover—not just hope your prevention tools held up.

Take ransomware, for example. It’s one of the biggest threats right now, locking up your files until you pay up or wiping them out entirely. Even with top-notch prevention, hackers can still sneak in. That’s where recovery shines—it lets you restore your data from a backup, minimizing downtime and financial losses. Studies show ransomware downtime can cost businesses thousands per minute, so quick recovery is a game-changer.

## How to Get Recovery Right

So, how do you make sure your backups save the day? Here are some practical steps:

- **Use the 3-2-1 Backup Rule**: Keep three copies of your data—two on different storage types (like hard drives and cloud), and one offsite (far away from your main location). This makes it harder for hackers to destroy everything. This approach aligns with recommendations in NIST 800-53 and other standards like HIPAA for healthcare or PCI DSS for payment data.
- **Test Your Recovery Plan**: Don’t just set up backups and forget them. Run drills to simulate a cyberattack and see if you can restore your systems quickly. Smith says this is rare, but it’s essential for confidence.
- **Get Expert Help**: Most companies don’t have the full picture of what hackers are up to—Smith calls this “breach context.” Partner with cybersecurity experts who understand current threats to set up backups that can survive attacks.
- **Balance Your Budget**: Don’t spend all your money on prevention tools. Shift some resources to recovery, like better backup tools, testing, and training for recovery teams.

## Why Every Industry Is at Risk

Here’s the scary part: no industry is safe. Whether you’re a small business, a hospital, or a nonprofit, you’re likely unprepared for mass recovery. Nowadays, barely one out of a hundred organizations have been observed to have a solid, survivable backup plan. That’s a wake-up call for everyone. Even big companies with plenty of resources are getting this wrong, often because they lean too heavily on vendor guidance that fails to address today’s threats.

## The Bigger Picture for 2025

Looking ahead, 2025 could be a rough year for cybersecurity. Hackers are targeting more sensitive sectors and hitting backups harder, so recovery isn’t just nice to have—it’s a must. Governments and industries might start pushing for better recovery standards, like regular testing or immutable backups (backups that can’t be changed or deleted). But for now, businesses need to take action themselves, guided by frameworks like NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and others.

## Prevention Still Counts, But Recovery Saves the Day

Don’t get me wrong—preventing attacks is still important. Firewalls, employee training, and monitoring can stop a lot of threats before they start. But when prevention fails (and it often does), recovery is what keeps you afloat. It’s like wearing a seatbelt: you hope you never crash, but if you do, you’re glad it’s there.
